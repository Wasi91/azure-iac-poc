## üíª Azure PowerShell Commands Used

**Note:** In this PoC, no advanced PowerShell scripts were used for deployment because the focus was to deploy via the "Deploy to Azure" button with ARM templates.  
However, here‚Äôs an example snippet to connect to Azure and ensure the environment is set up:

```powershell
# Login to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# Check available subscriptions
Get-AzSubscription

# Set the context to the correct subscription
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<your-subscription-id>"

# Example: create a Resource Group (if needed)
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "PoC-ResourceGroup" -Location "eastus"
```

**Note:** If your environment requires advanced PowerShell provisioning (e.g., KeyVaults, policies, managed identities), document them here.

---

## üìù Additional Notes / Deployment Observations

- The **Deploy to Azure** button requires publicly accessible raw file links (raw.githubusercontent.com).  
- For private repositories, consider using **Azure Pipelines** or **GitHub Actions** for deploying ARM templates securely.  
- No additional infrastructure (e.g., VNET, KeyVault, etc.) was pre-provisioned via PowerShell for this PoC.  
- No external modules or third-party scripts were used.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note
- The PoC was developed in a sandbox Azure subscription.  
- No production resources were impacted.
